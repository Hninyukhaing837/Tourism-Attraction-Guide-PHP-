	  <p >With its pristine, palm-tree-fringed white sand, the clear waters of the Bay of Bengal, and a host of sophisticated accommodation, Ngapali – supposedly named years ago by a homesick Italian reminiscing about Napoli – has a justified reputation as Myanmar's premier beach getaway.coming from the Bay of Bengal apart from its silver sands covering a wide and long stretch of coastal land.Similar to its older brother Ngapali in the north this unpolluted new beach faces the sea in the west offering a glorious sunset after painting the whole sky and sea with gold every evening.

           <div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
         <p>South of Ngapali and closer to Yangon, the resorts on this stretch of coast arrived a little more than a decade ago.The sea is as clear as it is in Ngapali, but the area isn't as developed, making it a seriously laid back spot and a great place to do nothing after exploring the country.Ngwe Saung Beach on the Myanmar shore of the Bay of Bengal. There are flights from Yangon -- a 35-minute trip -- but it's just as easy to do the six-hour road trip. If you want to savor the journey, you can take a 16-hour boat from Yangon to the gateway town of Pathein.</p>
     <p> When you've had enough of lying on the beach, there's scuba diving and snorkeling and an island at the end of the beach that you can walk out to at low tide. You can hire a motorbike if you want to explore the 15-kilometer beach and ride on the hard sand sections and take the road that runs alongside the beach for the rest.The seafood here is fantastic -- lobster, shrimp, crab, fish -- and if you're on the beach early in the morning you'll probably see fishermen coming in with their catch.Myanmar will host the 2013 Southeast Asian Games in December -- beach volleyball and sailing events will be held at Ngwe Saung Beach."I was there earlier this year," says Barker. "The resorts are spread out and range from $15 to $400 a night, some with very nice pools, but you don't need them because the sea is great.</p></div><hr></div>

         <p>Buddhist novices collect morning alms in Chuang Tha, about 240 kilometers west of Yangon, this beach is popular with middle-class families from the city.It's not as beautiful as Ngapali or Ngwe Saung beaches -- the sand isn't as white and the beachfront is a jumble of hotels -- but it's hugely popular, especially on weekends and holidays.If you're here during the high season and want to escape the crowds, you can hire a boat and explore one of the neighboring islands. You'll have to bring your own snorkel set to get a good look at the tropical fish."This is where you go if you want to see the Burmese at play," says Barker. "The beach is very commercial with lots of inflatable things going on. People say the beaches north of Chuang Tha are more attractive."</p></div><hr></div>

         <div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
         <p>Set-Se is a beach in Mon State. Whilst it can’t boast the white sand and blue waters of nearby Thailand, Set-Se has its own charms – not least being that there are few tourists there.The waters are warm and there is a large shallow shelf for paddling on. It’s a nice beach to just walk along as it is so large. If you get tired of walking you can ride a horse or hire a motorbike taxi. People even use these to get to the shoreline.You can hire tubes to float in and a range of food and drinks (alcoholic and non) are available</p></div><hr></div>

         <p>12 kilometres west of Dawei is Maungmagan beach (also spelt Maung Ma Kan), with its beautiful setting of hills rising straight up from the shoreline. There are a host of simple restaurants serving fresh seafood here and a 30 minute walk south will take you to a characterful fishing village with small boats nestled in its harbour – and some picture-perfect beer stations where you can relax and take in the views and sea breeze</p></div><hr></div>
