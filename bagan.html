    <div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
	  <p>Type of monument:Temple based - Indian Style Structure</br>
         Location : Southeast of Tharabar Gate</br>
         Region	: Old Bagan </br>
         Built by: King Kyanzittha</br>
         Date: A.D 1105</p>
       <p>Ananda temple is considered to be one of the most surviving masterpiece of the Mon architecture. Also known as the finest, largest, best preserved and most revered of the Bagan temples. During the 1975 earthquake, Ananda suffered considerable damage but has been totally restored.</p>
       <p>It is said to have been built around 1105 by King Kyanzittha, this perfectly proportioned temple heralds the stylistic end of the Early Bagan period and the beginning of the Middle period. In 1990, on the 900th anniversary of the temple's construction, the temple spires were gilded. The remainder of the temple exterior is whitewashed from time to time.</p></div><hr></div>

       <div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
       <p>Type of monument : Type II Pagoda (Zedi)</br>
            Location:Northeast of Old Bagan</br>
            Region	: Old Bagan</br>
            Built by: King Anawrahta</br>
            Date:A.D 1057</br>
            Monument Number: 1568</p>
        <p>King Anawrahta built Shwesandaw Pagoda after his conquest of Thaton in 1057. This graceful circular pagoda was constructed at the centre of his newly empowered kingdom. The pagoda was also known as Ganesh or Mahapeine after the elephant-headed Hindu god whose images once stood at the corners of the five successive terraces.
        The five terraces once bore terracotta plaques showing scenes from the jalakas, but traces of these, and of other sculptures, were covered by lather heavy-handed renovations. </p>
        <p>The pagoda's bell rises from two octagonal bases which top the five square terraces. This was the first monument in Bagan to feature stairways leading from the square bottom terraces to the round base of the pagoda itself. This pagoda supposedly enshrines a Buddha hair relic brought back from Thaton.The hti, which was toppled by the earthquake, can still be seen lying on the far side of the pagoda compound. A new one was fitted soon after tie quake.Before when people were allowed to climb up the terrace of the pagoda, it was a great spot to view the sunset of Bagan. But nowadays, to keep the ancient monuments in good shape, the stairways have been closed down. </p></div><hr></div>

        <div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
        <p>Type of monument:Type II Temple</br>
              Location  : Northwest of Kyanzittha Umin near the bank of Ayeyarwaddy River</br>
                          Region:Nyaung U & Wetkyi-In</br>
                          Built by:King Anawrahta</br>
                          Date: A.D 1076

<p>Shwezigon was built as the most important reliquary shrine in Bagan, a centre of prayer and reflection for the new Theravada faith King Anawarahta had established in Bagan.
The pagoda is standing between the village of Wetkyi-in and Nyaung U. It is a beautiful pagoda and was commenced by King Anawrahta but not completed until the reign of King Kyanzittha (1084-1113). King Kyanzittha was thought to have built his palace nearby.</p>
  
<p>It was known that, the Shwezigon was built to enshrine one of the four replicas of the Buddha tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka, and it was to mark the northern edge of the city. The other three tooth replicas were enshrined in other three more pagodas. The second tooth replica went to Lawkananda Pagoda, a smaller pagoda to the south end of the city. Then the third replica went to Tan Kyi Taung (Tant Kyi Hill) Pagoda, a pagoda on the western bank of the Ayeyarwady River.The last one was enshrined into Tu Yuan Taung (Tu Yuan Hill), a pagoda on the summit of a hill 32 km to the east.</p></div><hr></div>

<h1>Sulamani Temple</h1>
 <img src="Bagan images/Sulamani.jpg" />
 <div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
 <p>Type of monument:Type II Temple (Kundaung Pauk Gu)</br>
Location:About a mile east of Bagan</br>
Region:Minnanthu</br>
Built by:Narapatisithu</br>
Date:A.D 1183</br>
Monument Number:748</br>

<p>Sulamani was built in 1181 by Narapatisithu (1174-1211). This temple was known as "crowing jewel" and it stands beyond Dhammayangyi Pagoda. This temple is a more sophisticated temple than the Htilominlo and Gawdawpalin.Combining the horizontal planes of the early period with the vertical lines of the middle, the temple features two storeys standing on broad terraces assembled to create a pyramid effect. The brickwork throughout is considered some of the best in Bagan. Some part of the temple was damaged during 1975 by the earthquake. Pagodas stand at the corners of each terrace, and a high wall, fitted with elaborate gateways at each cardinal point, encloses the entire complex. The interior face of the wall was once lined with a hundred monastic cells, a feature unique among Bagan's ancient monasteries.</p>
<p>Sulamani represents some of Bagan's finest ornamental work which are carved stucco on mouldings, pediments and pilasters. These are today in fairly good condition. Glazed plaques around the base and terraces are also still visible.Buddha images face the four directions from the ground floor; the image at the main eastern entrance sits in a recess built into the wall. The interior passage around the base is painted with fine frescoes from the Konbaung period, and there are traces of earlier frescoes. Stairways lead very close to the top of this temple, from where the views are superb.</p></div><hr></div>

<h1>Thatbyinnyu Temple</h1>
<img src="Bagan images/Thatbyinnyu.jpg"/>
<div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
<p>Type of monument : Type II Temple</br>
Location : East of Gadawtpalin Temple</br>
Region : Nyaung U & Wetkyi-In</br>
Built by : King Alaungsithu</br>
Date : 11th Century

<p>Towering above the other monuments of Bagan, the magnificence in white which is the Thatbyinnyu takes its name from the Omniscience of the Buddha. Thatbyinnyutanyan in Myanmar language, Sabbannutanana in Pali, omniscience is given further explanation in contemporary inscriptions as "knowing thoroughly and seeing widely."</p>
<p>Built by King Alaungsithu (1113-1163), the Thatbyinnyu is a transitional temple, standing between the Early Style of the Ananda, half a mile to the northeast, and the Late Style of the Gawdawpalin, half a mile to the northwest. It is one of the earliest double-storeyed temples, but the arrangement is different from that of later double-storeyed temples, much as if it were still an experiment in the new form.The plan of the Thatbyinnyu is not unlike that of the Ananda-square, with porticoes on all four sides-but the eastern portico projects further than the others, breaking the symmetry. This plan is followed in such later temples as the Sulamani and the Gawdawpalin.</p></div><hr></div>

<h1>Dhammayangyi Pahto</h1>
<img src="Bagan images/Dhammayangyi.jpg"/>
<div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
<p>Extending 225 feet on a side, Dhammayangyi Pahto is the largest temple at Bagan. The pyramidical temple features very fine brickwork and an intriguing history: said to be built by a wicked king, the inner ambulatories may have been filled with rubble by spiteful workers after his death in about 1170 AD.The date and builder of the Dhammayangyi Pahto are matters of some scholarly controversy, but it is generally thought to have been built by King Narathu (r. c.1167-70).</p>
<p>According to legend, Narathu built the temple to atone for his wicked rule: he smothered his father and brother to death and had one of his wives, an Indian princess, executed for practicing her Hindu rituals.
The bad king's own death is variously attributed to priest-assassins sent by the princess' angry father or to a Ceylonese (Sri Lankan) mission that not only killed the king but sacked the city and brought Ceylonese influence to the area.It seems that the temple's construction ceased upon the king's death and was never finished. Intriguingly, almost all the inner ambulatory passages were filled with rubble around the time of its construction. Some suggest that the workers not only stopped work on the temple when the king died, but filled the ambulatories out of spite.</p></div><hr></div>

<h1>Buphaya</h1>
<img src="Bagan images/Buphaya.jpg"/>
<div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
<p>Type of monument : Type I Temple (Bibulous dome)<br>
Location : On the eastern bank of Ayeyarwaddy River<br>
Region : Old Bagan <br>
Built by : King Pyusawhti<br>
Date : A.D 162

<p>Bupaya means the "a gourd shape pagoda". The legend says, the third king of Bagan, Pyusawhti (AD 162-243), got rid of the gourd-like climbing plant "bu" that infested the riverbanks, before becoming the king. He was rewarded by his predecessor, Thamuddarit, the founder of Bagan (AD 108) together with the hand of his daughter and the heir to the throne of Bagan. He then in the commemoration of his good luck built a gourd-shaped pagoda on the bank of the Ayeyarwaddy River. This cylindrical Pyu-style stupa is said to be the oldest in Bagan. Bupaya was completely destroyed when it tumbled into the river in the 1975 earthquake, but has since been totally rebuilt. The distinctively shaped bulbous stupa stands above rows of crenellated terraces. The view from the river is also a breath-taking one. </p></div><hr></section>
