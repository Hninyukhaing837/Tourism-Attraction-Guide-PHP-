	  <p >The statue was already ancient in 1784 when it was seized from Mrauk U by the Burmese army of King Bodawpaya. The epic story of how it was dragged back to Mandalay is retold in a series of 1950s paintings in a picture gallery across the pagoda's inner courtyard to the northeast of the Buddha image. Bodawpaya also nabbed a collection of Hindu-Buddhist Khmer bronze figures, which had already been pilfered centuries earlier from Angkor Wat, and reached Mrauk U by a series of other historical thefts. Many figures were reputedly melted down to make cannons for Mandalay's 1885 defence against the British. But six rather battered figures remain, which have all been rubbed raw by devotees seeking good health. They're housed in a drab concrete building near the giant gong on the north side of the northwest inner courtyard.Near Mahamuni's outer northeast exit you'll find a merrily kitsch clock tower and the Maha Buddhavamsa Museum of World Buddhism, which is effectively a gallery of paintings about the life of the Buddha, and photos of archaeological sites associated with that saga.From the central shrine with its multi-tiered golden roof, long concrete passageways leading in each cardinal direction are crammed with stalls selling all manner of religio-tourist trinkets. The western passage emerges on 84th St amid fascinating marble workshops, where buddha statues are expertly crafted using power tools.Mahamuni can be conveniently visited en route to Amarapura, Inwa or Sagaing.</p></div><hr></div>

           <div style="padding: 0em 1em 1em">
         <p>The Mandalay Palace located in Mandalay, Myanmar, is the last royal palace of the last Burmese monarchy. The palace was constructed, between 1857 and 1859 as part of King Mindon's founding of the new royal capital city of Mandalay. The plan of Mandalay Palace largely follows the traditional Burmese palace design, inside a walled fort surrounded by a moat. The palace itself is at the centre of the citadel and faces east. All buildings of the palace are of one storey in height. The number of spires above a building indicated the importance of the area below.</p>
       <p>  Mandalay Palace was the primary royal residence of King Mindon and King Thibaw, the last two kings of the country. The complex ceased to be a royal residence and seat of government on 28 November 1885 when, during the Third Anglo-Burmese War, troops of the Burma Field Force entered the palace and captured the royal family. The British turned the palace compound into Fort Dufferin, named after the then viceroy of India. Throughout the British colonial era, the palace was seen by the Burmese as the primary symbol sovereignty and identity. Much of the palace compound was destroyed during World War II by allied bombing; only the royal mint and the watch tower survived. A replica of the palace was rebuilt in the 1990s with some modern materials.Today, Mandalay Palace is a primary symbol of Mandalay and a major tourist destination.The Mandalay Palace's formal name in Burmese is Mya Nan San Kyaw .It is also known as "Great Golden Royal Palace".

Following its move, it became the northern section of the Glass Palace and also part of the king’s royal apartments. It would also be the final home and resting place of King Mindon, who died in this structure in 1878.</p>
     <p> King Mindon’s son Thibaw, who succeeded his father following his death, often used the building as meditation grounds, but became convinced that his father’s spirit still haunted the grounds, so he immediately ordered the building to be dismantled and removed from the Royal City.Over the course of the next 5 years following its dismantling, the building was reconstructed as a monastery and dedicated as a work of merit to the memory of King Mindon.During the latter stages of World War II, the rest of the old Royal Palace within the old Royal City burned as a result of allied bombing of the Japanese encamped in the old Royal Palace. Due to King Thibaw’s superstition and relocating of the building, he had preserved a significant remnant of the Royal Palace..</p></div><hr></div>

         <p>From the foot of the Yankin Paya access stairway, backtrack 300yd towards Mandalay then turn north and go another 300yd north to find this modern monastery with its dazzlingly distinctive brassy stupa. Mya Kyauk is famed for its subterranean source of moderately alkaline mineral water, found by faith-led digging in 1998. The water supposedly ‘promotes IQ and ameliorates diabetes, constipation, gout and morning sickness’.The only way to try it is to first seek an audience with the head monk, Bhaddanta Khaymar Sarya, who may deign to give you a bottle of it. Before opening the bottle, try holding it up to the sunlight and play. If you hit on the right angle, the light projects an image reminiscent of the monastery stupa onto the back of the label. ‘Magic’, claim the locals. Or at least good bottle design.</p>
    <p> The British invaded and ransacked the palace and burned down the royal library.The royal regalia of Burma were removed as military booty and displayed in the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A Museum, London). In 1964 they were returned to Burma as a gesture of goodwill  The British renamed the palace compound Fort Dufferin and used it to billet troops. During World War II, the palace citadel was turned into a supply depot by the Japanese and was carelessly burnt to the ground by Allied bombing. Only the royal mint and the watch tower survived.Reconstruction of the palace began in 1989, initiated by the Department of Archaeology.Because government funds were insufficient, the Mandalay Committee for the palace Reconstruction was formed, with funds coming from the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which patronized this project. The regional governments of Mandalay, Magwe and Sagaing Divisions were responsible for drawing up architectural plans and constructing various parts of the palace.</p>
